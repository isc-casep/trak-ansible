$ ansible-playbook helloworld.yml
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: No JSON object could be decoded

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  mapping values are not allowed in this context

The error appears to be in '/tmp/helloworld.yml': line 8, column 13, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

      content: hello world
        dest: /tmp/testfile.txt
            ^ here
